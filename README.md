# Sample_Code
It is a deep learning model (LSTM) for the classification of two classes (each class has two features), which was applied to a large dataset. 

It has consisted three phases:
1. Labeling phase, which is based on our desirable features.
2. Preprocessing, involves making windows (according to our desirable step size) and class balancing.
3. Training our LSTM model and testing its performance.
